This is Alano
i hope you read this, even if it's too late
i don't even know you'll ever read this.
but if you do... i just want you to know, i still think about you sometimes.
we both tried. we both cared. but the universe just never gave us enough space to become "us." 
i just wonder.... if we had met at a different point in life, would the ending have been different? 
Anyway, i hope you're doing okay,even though we're not in each other's lives anymore.
